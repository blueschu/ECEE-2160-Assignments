\section*{Summary}

This prelab assignment consisted of two parts. In the first part, the \texttt{gdb} debugger was used to introspect the execution of an instructor provided C++ program. In the second part, an interactive menu program was prepared, which will be used for testing a linked list implementation during the lab. Both parts were completed on a host machine running a GNU/Linux operating system\footnote{Linux Mint 19.3, ker. 4.15.0, arch. x86\_64.}. Programs were compiled using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) C++ compiler version 7.5.0., and debugged using the GNU \texttt{gdb} debugger version 8.1.

\section*{Submission}

\subsection*{Part I}
The instructor-provided \texttt{person.cpp} file may be found in Listing~\ref{lst:instructor/person.cpp} below. This file was compiled into an executable with debug info using the following shell command.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=labreportstyle-sh,escapechar=!]
$ g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -o person ./person.cpp       # Compile executable
$ file ./person                                             # Confirm added debug info
person: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=cd8698296f4f24be431e5dd622c4e2d09bae7707, !\bfseries\colorbox{yellow!30!orange!20!white}{with debug\_info}!, not stripped
\end{lstlisting}
The execution of this program was then analyzed with the following \texttt{gdb} session. Comments and explanations are included on the right hand side following a \texttt{\#} sign.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=labreportstyle-sh,escapechar=!]

\subsection*{Part II}
The part consisted of preparing an interactive menu program that could be used to test a linked list implementation during the lab. This program is provided in Listing~\ref{lst:prelab.cpp} in the Appendix. 

The prelab program was compiled and tested with the following shell session. User inputs were provided as requested by the program.
