\section*{Introduction}

This lab was an introduction to using Quartus to design combinational logic circuits. Half-adder and full-adder circuits were designed using the Quartus block diagram editor. These circuits were then mapped onto the DE1-SoC board's FPGA, and their behavior was verified by interacting with the board's I/O devices. The full-adder circuit was then used to develop an 8-bit adder circuit, which was tested using Quartus' circuit simulation tools. 

\section*{Lab Discussion}

\subsection*{Materials}

The following materials were used to complete this lab.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Host computer (Linux Mint 19.3, x86\_64)
    \item DE1-SoC board (de1soclinux, armv7l)
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Software}
Intel's Quartus Prime Lite Edition (version 20.1) was installed on the host machine.

\subsection*{Prelab Assignment}

The prelab assignment consisted of preparing truth tables and circuit diagrams for the half- and full-adder circuits.

            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{subtable}
\end{table}

In preparation for creating the circuit diagrams, these truth tables were translated into boolean equations and then reduced using boolean algebra identities as follows \cite{fell-discrete-structure}.

\paragraph{Half-Adder}
\begin{align*}
S(A,B) &= A'B + AB' = A\oplus B \\
C(A,B) &= A B
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Full-Adder}
\begin{align*}
S(A,B,C_\mathrm{in}) &= A'B'C_\mathrm{in} + A'BC_\mathrm{in}' + AB'C_\mathrm{in}' + ABC_\mathrm{in}\\
&= A'(B'C_\mathrm{in} + BC_\mathrm{in}') + A(B'C_\mathrm{in}' + BC_\mathrm{in})\\
&= A'\left(B \oplus C\right) +A((B + C_\mathrm{in})' +BC_\mathrm{in})\\
&= A'\left(B \oplus C\right) +A(B\oplus C_\mathrm{in})'\\
&= A \oplus (B \oplus C_\mathrm{in})\\
C_\mathrm{out}(A,B,C_\mathrm{in}) &= A'BC_\mathrm{in} + AB'C_\mathrm{in} + ABC_\mathrm{in}' + ABC_\mathrm{in}\\
&= C_\mathrm{in} (A'B + AB') + AB\cancelto{1}{(C_\mathrm{in}' + C_\mathrm{in})}\\
&= C_\mathrm{in}\left(A\oplus B\right) + AB
\end{align*}

These equation were then translated to the following circuit diagrams.

\section*{Results and Analysis}

\section*{Assignment 1 and 2}
Lab assignments 1 and 2 consisted of designing, respectively, a half-adder and a full-adder circuit in Quartus. The block diagrams for these circuits are provided in Figures~\ref{fig:lab5_3_1_bit_adder_lookahead} and~\ref{fig:lab5-2-full-adder} below. These circuits were loaded onto the DE1-SoC board's FPGA, with the inputs mapped to the board's switches and the outputs mapped to the board's LEDs. The correctness of the adder circuits was  verified by exhaustively testing all possible input combinations of the board's switches and examining the resulting state of the LEDs. Both circuit behaved as expected.

     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,clip,trim={7cm 21cm 4cm 4.5cm}]%

    \caption{Block diagram of the half-adder circuit.}\label{fig:lab5_3_1_bit_adder_lookahead}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]

    {images/ecee2160-lab5-2-full-adder.pdf}
    \caption{Block diagram of full-adder circuit.}\label{fig:lab5-2-full-adder}
\end{figure}

The full-adder circuit consists of two half-adders: one that adds the two input signals $A$ and $B$, and another that adds the ``sum'' output of the previous adder with the ``carry-in'' signal $C_\mathrm{in}$. The final sum-output $S$ of the full-adder circuit is the sum produced by the second half-adder. The carry-out signal $C_\mathrm{out}$ is given by the logical OR of the carry-outs from the two half-adders since either step may result in an overflow. A single OR gate can be used instead of a more complex circuit since only one of the two additions can overflow for any given input.


\section*{Assignment 3}
This assignment consisted of designing an 8-bit adder circuit. This circuit was partitioned into three Quartus block diagrams:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a top-level 8-bit carry-lookahead adder circuit (Figure ~\ref{fig:lab5_3_8_bit_adder}), 
    \item a 1-bit full-adder circuit with propagation and generation outputs (Figure~\ref{lab5_3_1_bit_adder_lookahead}), and
    \item an 8-bit carry-look circuit (Figure~\ref{fig:lab5_3_8_carry_lookahead}).
\end{enumerate}

The adder circuit was tested using the Quartus Simulation Waveform Editor \cite{quartus-waveform-sim}. Test signals consisting of ten randomly-generated 8-bit integers were applied to the two input groups ($A$ and $B$), and a counter signal that alternated between $0$ and $1$ was applied to the carry-in input ($C_\mathrm{in}$). 
The simulation results are provided in Figures~\ref{fig:lab5-3-8bit-1-bin} and~\ref{fig:lab5-3-8bit-1-dec} below. These figures display the input and output signals in binary and decimal representations, respectively. The correctness of the 8-bit adder circuit could be verified by direct computation using the decimal values of the simulation results. All input combinations tested resulted in their expected outputs.

The carry-out signal of the 8-bit adder ($C_\mathrm{out}$) indicated whether the result of adding the two input integers exceeded the maximum that can be stored in an 8-bit integer (i.e., $2^8 - 1 = 255$). This output signal can be used to properly propagate overflows in computations involving more than 8 bits of precision.

\section*{Conclusion}

This lab illustrated the process of designing large combinational circuits by combining smaller logical units. Basic half-adder and full-adder circuits were implemented using Quartus and were tested by mapping them onto a FPGA board. These circuits were then used to develop an 8-bit adder circuit, which was verified using simulation software. Common issues when designing combinational circuits such as carry propagation and delay were considered and addressed during lab assignments. 

A possible extension for this lab would be using the implemented 8-bit adder circuit to design a higher-precision adder, such as a 32-bit or 64-bit adder. Additionally, during this lab, no requirements were imposed on the design of the adder circuits other that their terminal behavior. Therefore this lab might be further extended by introducing constraints to the circuit design process such as minimizing time complexity or power consumption.
